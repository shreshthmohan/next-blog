subtitle: "How I earned ‚Çπ30,000 by selling a bunch of old junk online"

I was nearing the last working days of the job that I recently quit, I thought whether I should leave Bangalore. It was a good idea to start reducing the amount of stuff I owned if I planned to leave. I wasn‚Äôt very sure though. It made sense to downsize anyway.

So, I started taking photos of things I wouldn‚Äôt need and put them up on OLX. I knew I had a lot of junk, but when I started digging stuff out of boxes lying around I realized it was more than I had thought. I had two football pumps for instance! Badminton and squash rackets I hadn‚Äôt used in more than a year. As I had been more focused on outdoor activities like hiking and cycling, I didn‚Äôt think twice about letting go of stuff I hadn‚Äôt used in a while.

## Limits!

Once a few products sold, I got more confident about selling more, but then came an unexpected revelation. OLX has limits on how many ads one can put up for each category, and one has to wait up to 60 days or pay up to post more ads.

This was a major roadblock because I wanted to get rid of all the unused stuff in one go. That‚Äôs because selling used stuff is distracting and time-consuming. It‚Äôs like an unpredictable day job. Buyers might message or call you unexpectedly, ask a bunch of questions and eventually never turn up to make the deal. You can‚Äôt really focus on other work if you‚Äôre selling more than a few items.

## A new find!

So while I was exploring alternatives to Olx, I stumbled upon Facebook Marketplace! I haven‚Äôt been actively using Facebook for the last few years and didn‚Äôt plan to change that. But Facebook Marketplace is an amazing piece of software, especially for selling used products.

Facebook Marketplace is better because,

1. There are no limits to how many products you can list.
2. The pool of potential buyers is bigger
3. Your communications with sellers are better organized, you can see all your conversations grouped by each item.

And of course, no product is perfect, Facebook Marketplace has a few downsides too.

1. You might find people making unreasonable requests. People asked me to ship to another city and expected cash on delivery, for an item I was selling for ‚Çπ200. The cheapest courier service would cost at least the same amount. This never happened on OLX.
2. I feel that there are more non-serious buyers on FB because people go to OLX with a clear intent of buying.
3. Facebook can be very distracting. I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy using Facebook, and because it‚Äôs all in one place and it‚Äôs easy to get distracted on Facebook
4. People might ridicule you for selling low-value items. I either ignore such people or tell them, ‚Äúeverything sells.‚Äù üòä

If you have a lot of items to sell, say more than 10, try to list on both Facebook Marketplace as well as OLX. Prefer OLX if you are selling fewer and high-value items.

Great, I had a new place to sell which doesn‚Äôt have a limit on listing count. But what I thought would be a few days of work, became a shitty day job. So I tried selling faster.

## Selling Faster

I figured out that people bought a product very quickly if you offered them door delivery. Humans are lazy. Some deliveries were made by me on my bicycle or on a two-wheeler on my way to a friend‚Äôs place and some via apps like Dunzo or Porter. All except one delivery went smoothly.

Another strategy that works well is pitting buyers against each other by just letting them know that you have another buyer making an offer. This is especially useful when some buyers become inactive after making an offer.

I am not proud to be mentioning this, but I lied to some inactive buyers by asking them if they were still interested and I was checking with them before I made a deal with another buyer because they were the first ones to reach out. I did this to sell a product that had seen some activity but no buyer actually took the final step.

Things sell faster if you have all the accessories, the original packaging, and the invoice. So don‚Äôt throw away the packaging and invoice when you buy a used or a new item. It also helps if your item belongs to a well-known brand. It‚Äôs also a good idea to add product details, search the product on Amazon and Google to find out the details of the product. For instance, I sold a Dell laptop adapter and it helped to figure out which laptops that charger was compatible with.

```js
const x = 1 + 1;
```

## Negotiation

While taking good photos, writing a concise description, and setting an expected price are almost necessary to make a sale, negotiation is what you will spend most of your time on. So I think it‚Äôs important to negotiate fast and well.

Here are some tactics I employed.

1. Don‚Äôt reveal your ‚Äúlast‚Äù price, unless you‚Äôre in a hurry and you think the buyer is not a haggler. You‚Äôve already mentioned a price in the listing, so if a buyer asks you for a price just repeat that. If they still insist, ask them to make an offer. Once they choose a number they can‚Äôt go below that price.
2. In some cases, if a buyer is in a hurry they will easily agree to your price. Give them a number and don‚Äôt respond for some time if they keep low-balling. Some buyers might automatically increase their offers. In one case a buyer agreed to my price within a few minutes of silence from my side.
3. Some buyers will point out flaws or missing accessories for your item. It‚Äôs pretty easy to say that you would have listed at a higher price if your item didn‚Äôt have those flaws.

## Everything sells

Well almost. As I sold more and more stuff I thought of trying to sell stuff that I didn‚Äôt even think could even sell. More for the experimentation than the money. USB charging adapters, for instance. I think they are all the same except in terms of wattage. But not everyone thinks like me. An original 5W Apple iPod USB adapter is probably more valuable on the market than a 20W fast charger one from almost any other brand. I sold one for ‚Çπ500! One the other hand got laughed at for even thinking of listing a Xiaomi USB adapter.

## Scams and Surprises

Selling online comes with its own risks, especially in India. The most common scam I encountered was people accepting your listed price and agreeing to pay advance. What they do is send you a QR code which is actually a payment request and make it seem like a request which will credit money to your account. And usually, these people respond very quickly and almost never negotiate.

Amidst all of this, I was surprised when a buyer actually paid money in advance. I was so surprised and skeptical that I asked him how he trusted me and sent the money before actually getting the items. I could have refused to send him the products and blocked his number. Of course, I didn‚Äôt. And the sale happened smoothly except for a botch-up by the delivery truck driver who extracted money from both of us. I later got the issue resolved by the delivery service provider, namely Porter.

I also managed to sell an item to a buyer in another city. I asked a friend who has an online store if I could use her delivery partner to ship the item. She graciously agreed and it was only ‚Çπ155 to ship a 1kg package from Bangalore to Kochi. And the package was picked up from my doorstep. I later found out that one doesn‚Äôt need to have a business account to use Delhivery Direct‚Äôs service. Neat, eh?

## Taking a step back

In conclusion, selling your old junk on OLX and Facebook Marketplace is a great way to declutter and generate some extra cash. But it can take over your life and become akin to a day job. I have sold 24 items so far and still have 15 unsold items listed, but I have disabled notifications for both OLX and Facebook Marketplace and I check notifications only once a day or so to keep my sanity.

If you are curious about what I sold and for how much, I am attaching a table here for your reference. By the way, I lied! ‚Çπ14,000 out of the total ‚Çπ30,000 I got by selling old junk went to my friends whose items I sold on their behalf.
